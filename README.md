# Crop Disease Detection using Plant Village Dataset

## Overview
This project aims to detect crop diseases using machine learning techniques, specifically utilizing the Plant Village dataset. The Plant Village dataset is a large collection of labeled images of various plant species affected by different diseases and pests. By leveraging this dataset, we train a model to classify images of crops and identify diseases accurately.

## Dataset
The Plant Village dataset contains images of various crop species including tomatoes, potatoes, apples, and grapes, among others. Each image is labeled with the corresponding crop type and disease present, providing a comprehensive resource for training machine learning models for crop disease detection.
